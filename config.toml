#### -CHEMICAL-FREE INVASIVE & NOXIOUS WEED REMOVAL-\n
#### -TARGETTED ECOLOGICAL GRAZING-\n
#### -INTEGRATED FOOD & ECOLOGY CONSULTING-\n
#### -URBAN FOOD & NATIVE PLANT LANDSCAPING-\n
#### -REGIONAL GARDEN & PLANTING CONSULTATION-\n
#### -CUSTOM YURT CONSTRUCTION-\n
The Social-Ecological Graziers Guild's mission is to reduce invasive and unwanted vegetation in public spaces and vacant lots, utilizing goats for browsing. Working in and around the Finger Lakes in Western New York, the Social-Ecological Graziers Guild accomplishes this mission by partnering with organizations, land owners, and businesses and allowing the goat herd to eat vegetation on the overgrown properties. Giving goats access to intentional properties removes vegetation in an eco-friendly and efficient manner, setting the stage for additional land management and restoration. We also promote goat husbandry, education and resources access for those interested in raising goats in the Finger Lakes region.

By clearing unwanted vegetation with goats rather than using management products like herbicides, communities gain a number of benefits. Goats can traverse terrain that is difficult or impossible for people and machinery. They work long hours, and the only fuel they require is the plants they'll eat. Goats clearing an overgrown neighborhood space can create good community conversation, provide volunteer opportunities to increase community engagement, and pave the way to new opportunities in shared spaces!"""
