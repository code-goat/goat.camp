		description = """The Social-Ecological Graziers Guild's mission is to promote bioregional awareness and to reduce invasive or dominating vegetation in environmentally responsible ways. Working in and around the Finger Lakes in Western New York, the Social-Ecological Graziers Guild accomplishes this mission by partnering with organizations, land owners, and businesses to allow our targeted goat herd to eat vegetation on overgrown properties. Goats help open space and reduce plant competition, thus setting the stage for additional land management and restoration, such as re-introducing native, medicinal & food plants.
		\nBy clearing unwanted vegetation with goats rather than using management products like herbicides, we help keep our waterways clean while restoring native plant communities. Goats can traverse terrain that is difficult or impossible for people and machinery. They work long hours, and the only fuel they require is the plants they'll eat. Goats clearing an overgrown neighborhood space can create good community conversation, provide volunteer opportunities to increase community engagement, and pave the way to new opportunities in shared spaces!
		\nWe offer Social-Ecological Services, Products, Consulting & Education in the Finger Lakes Region of Upstate New York (Haudenosaunee Anscestral Territory), including:\n
#### •TARGETED ECOLOGICAL GRAZING\n
#### •CHEMICAL-FREE INVASIVE & NOXIOUS WEED REMOVAL\n
#### •INTEGRATED FOOD & ECOLOGY CONSULTING\n
#### •URBAN FOOD & NATIVE PLANT LANDSCAPING\n
#### •REGIONAL GARDEN & PLANTING CONSULTATION\n
