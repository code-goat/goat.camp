description: "## Why clear overgrown land with goats?\n### • Effective:\n#### The herd can manage steep slopes and remove thorny, itchy, and invasive plants where people and machinery can not.\n### • Eco-friendly:\n#### Goats manage vegetation without herbicides, and they reduce the need for excessive fuels and expensive machinery. This leaves our watersheds clean while naturally aerating and fertilizing the soil. Goats also reduce a the invasive seed bank in our soils by eating the plant before they can even form seeds. With successive grazing, goats will eventually starve the starches from a plants root system entirely-- effectively killing that invasive plant.\n### • Engaging:\n#### There's no better way for a community to engage in ecological learning than to see cute, fuzzy animals doing it in their own neighborhoods! If you're looking for community involvement around your school, park, or neighborhood, goats are the way to go!\n### If you have a private or public project and you wonder if grazing would be a good fit for you,\n## [CONTACT US!](mailto:segg@tuta.io) to find out more.\n### Some of the plants we work with:\n### Poison Ivy, Japanese Knotweed, English Ivy, Black Locust, Honey Locust, Honey Suckle, Virginia Creeper, Buckthorn, Autumn Olive, Sassafrass, Multi-Flora Rose, Wild Grape, and more!"
