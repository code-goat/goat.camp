If you are interested in starting to work with goats as pack animals, we'd be happy to share some of that experience with you. \n## [CONTACT US!](mailto:segg@tuta.io)\n### if you have questions about how to get started; or if you're looking for pack goat kids to start your own herd; or if you'd like to hire us for our consultating and packing services, etc."
